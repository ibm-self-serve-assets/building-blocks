# Key Aspects for Creating a Technology Building Block: Application Observability with IBM Instana

## 1. Clear Objectives
- Define the **purpose** of the building block  (e.g., monitoring microservices, APM, incident response).
- Highlight **business value** (reduced MTTR, better user experience, proactive detection).

## 2. Environment Setup
- Use **containerized workloads** (e.g., OpenShift) or **VM-based apps**.
- Ensure **sample applications** (e.g., microservices, app) with meaningful transactions.
- Provide **pre-configured Instana agent deployment steps**.

## 3. Agent Deployment
- Demonstrate **simple installation** of the Instana agent on:
  - OpenShift clusters
  - VMs (Linux/Windows)
  - Docker containers
- Show **auto-discovery** of services and dependencies.

## 4. Key Observability Features
- **Service & Infrastructure Monitoring**  
  Visualize application services, APIs, and backend infrastructure.
- **Automatic Root Cause Analysis**  
  Show how Instana detects bottlenecks and pinpoints issues.
- **Trace Analysis**  
  Display distributed tracing across microservices.
- **Metrics & Dashboards**  
  Pre-build dashboards for CPU, memory, response times, and error rates.
- **Custom Events & Alerts**  
  Demonstrate setting up health rules and proactive alerting.

## 5. Application Scenarios
- Simulate **traffic load** (e.g., using locust, JMeter, or k6).
- Trigger **failure scenarios** (e.g., kill a pod, DB slowdown) to showcase RCA.
- Highlight **end-user experience monitoring**.

## 6. Integration Points
- Integrate with **IBM Cloud Pak for AIOps** or **Slack/Teams for notifications**.
- Show **API-driven data export** to other observability platforms if needed.
- Highlight ***integration*** with other IBM / Non - IBM offerings (Turbonomic, Concert, Kubecost) as per building block.

## 7. building block     Flow & Storytelling
- Begin with a **healthy system view** (baseline monitoring).
- Introduce an **issue or anomaly**.
- Use Instana’s features to **detect, analyze, and resolve** the issue.
- Close by showing **improved system state** after resolution.

## 8. Documentation & Reusability
- Provide **step-by-step setup instructions** (OpenShift-focused if applicable).
- Include **Terraform/Helm scripts** for automated setup.
- Keep the building block **repeatable, simple, and modular** for quick re-runs.
- ***Architecture Diagram*** of the building block.

## 9. Visualization & User Experience
- Use **clear dashboards, heatmaps, and service maps** for storytelling.
- Highlight the **ease of navigation** from high-level insights to detailed traces.

## 10. Best Practices
- Focus on **simplicity** (avoid overcomplicating setup).
- Ensure **data consistency** across metrics, traces, and logs.
- Keep the building block **time-bound (10–15 minutes)** for effectiveness.
- Provide **cleanup instructions** to avoid leftover resources/costs.

## Folder Purpose
- **`manifests/`** → Deployment configs for app & Instana agent (OpenShift-ready).  
- **`helm/`** → Helm-based deployment option.  
- **`scripts/`** → Automation (deploy, clean up, simulate incidents).  
- **`dashboards/`** → Exported Instana dashboards for reuse.  
- **`traces/`** → Pre-captured trace data for building block fallback.  
- **`alerts/`** → Alert rules for errors, latency, anomalies.  
- **`docs/`** → Solution Architecture + documentation.

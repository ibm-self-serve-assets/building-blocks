At Bingle, we don't have the option to change your policy from Comprehensive to Third Party Property Damage, or vice versa. If you want to change the level of cover, youâ€™ll need to start up a NEW Comprehensive Insurance (https://online.bingle.com.au/motor/pub/binglequote?productType=comprehensive) or Third Party Property Damage (https://online.bingle.com.au/motor/pub/binglequote?productType=thirdParty) policy online, and cancel (https://online.bingle.com.au/onesuncorp) the existing policy. Cancelling within the cooling off period. If you change your mind within 21 days of when your policy starts, and you haven't made a claim, you can cancel your policy and receive a full refund. Just make sure you select 'Cooling off' as the reason for the cancellation, and select the start date of your policy as the cancellation date. If a refund is due to you, this will automatically be issued back to the original card you used to pay for the policy. To cancel your policy please follow our instructions here: I need to cancel my policy. (https://help.bingle.com.au/hc/en-us/articles/20727718 8) Cancelling after the cooling off period. After the cooling off period you can still cancel your policy, and we'll refund the unexpired portion of your premium, less any non-refundable government charges, if the refund is more than $1

Weâ€™re sorry to hear your car has been written off. Hopefully youâ€™re back on the road ASAP with some new wheels to get you around. Until then, you may be worried about your policy taking any more payments and are in a hurry to stop the payments. There are two ways that cars can be deemed a total loss (written off): by Bingle, or by the other personâ€™s insurer. Who is doing the writing off will determine what you need to do next. 1 - Total Loss by Bingle If the vehicle has been written off by Bingle, you do not need to do anything. If you have New for Old cover, then weâ€™ll organise the replacement and the policy will continue (more info about that can be found here (https://help.bingle.com.au/hc/en-us/articles/115008068468-What-is-New-for-Old-)). If you donâ€™t have New for Old cover, when your claim is settled, Bingle will organise for your policy to be cancelled. If you pay monthly, any remaining debits left owing are deducted from the final settlement, so if any other payments are taken before the cancellation occurs, these will simply be applied against the deduction. More information about this can be found in our Comprehensive Car Insurance PDS (https://www.bingle.com.au/documents/disclosures/comp_pds_2021031 6.pdf) on Page 16 under the heading When your car is a total loss. 2 - Total Loss by another insurer If your car has been involved in an accident and your car was assessed and deemed to be a total loss through the other partyâ€™s insurance, they do not notify us of this. It is important that you process the insurance policy cancellation yourself. This car be done via Bingle Self-Service here (https://online.bingle.com.au/onesuncorp). Alternatively, if youâ€™ve already got a new car, you can swap it out here (https://online.bingle.com.au/onesuncorp). Iâ€™ve scrapped my car You may also decide that your car is no longer worth keeping and you decide to scrap it. Cancelling the registration does not cancel the Comprehensive or Third Party insurance policy, so you will need to cancel the policy. This can be done via Bingle Self-Service. (https://online.bingle.com.au/onesuncorp) For instructions on how to do this, check out 'How do I cancel my policy?' (https://help.bingle.com.au/hc/en-us/articles/207277188-How-do-I-cancel-my-policy-).

Compulsory Third Party Insurance, or â€˜Green Slipâ€™ as itâ€™s known in New South Wales and â€˜MAIâ€™ in the Australian Capital Territory, is a mandatory type of insurance that you purchase along with your vehicle registration. This isnâ€™t the same as Third Party Car Insurance. In most states, CTP/MAI is included with your registration fees, however if youâ€™re in New South Wales or the Australian Capital Territory, youâ€™ll have the option to nominate which insurer will provide your CTP/MAI cover when you pay for your registration. CTP/MAI Insurance can cover you or the other driverâ€™s liability if someone is injured in an accident â€“ be it you, other drivers, passengers, pedestrians, or cyclists. Bingle doesnâ€™t offer CTP Insurance, however you can purchase it from AAMI (https://www.aami.com.au/ctp-insurance.html) or GIO (https://www.gio.com.au/ctp-insurance/nsw-ctp-green-slip.html). Third Party Car Insurance (https://www.bingle.com.au/car-insurance/third-party-car-insurance.html), on the other hand, is a level of insurance that only covers damage you cause to other peopleâ€™s car and property, i.e. damage caused by your car, but not your legal liability for injuries. What do I do If I purchased Third Party Car Insurance instead of CTP? Bingle doesnâ€™t offer CTP insurance, so if youâ€™ve purchased Third Party Car Insurance from us and tried to register it with your state or territoryâ€™s road authority as CTP Insurance, you wonâ€™t be allowed to register. If you need to cancel your Third Party Car Insurance, head to Bingle Self-Service (https://online.bingle.com.au/onesuncorp) and cancel your policy. If you cancel your policy within 21 days of purchasing it â€“ and you havenâ€™t made a claim â€“ you could be eligible for our cooling off period, where you can cancel your policy and receive a full refund. Read this article for more information on our cooling off period https://help.bingle.com.au/hc/en-us. The information is intended to be of general nature only. Subject to any rights you may have under any law, we do not accept any legal responsibility for any loss or damage, including loss of business or profits or any other indirect loss, incurred as a result of reliance upon the information.

without the ownerâ€™s consent. And if you need to make a claim with us relating to the substitute car, you will need to authorise us to lodge the claim on your policy and pay us any applicable excess. â€¢ Hire Car.
Bingle will arrange for a hire car for you to use. The hire car will be one that is a similar make and model to your car. If a similar make and model to your car is not available, you can choose the nearest equivalent car from our provider, but only if our provider has one available, and is within a reasonable distance of your location. o You can use a hire car for as long as it takes us to settle your claim. But, if we cannot provide you with a hire car from one of our providers within a reasonable distance from your location, we will pay you up to $50 a day (including GST) to help you make your own travel arrangements. We will pay from when you asked us to arrange a hire car, to until we have settled your claim. o Do not forget - during the time you have a hire car it is also covered by our Copycat Cover.
Refer to â€œKeeping up with claims under the â€˜Keep Mobileâ€™ optionâ€ on page 17 of the PDS for further information.

If you want to add the Keep Mobile option to your policy, you can do so at anytime provided that: â€¢ Your car hasnâ€™t been involved in an accident â€¢ And there are no current or pending claims on the car Please Note â€¢ Learner drivers are not covered to drive hire cars â€¢ This option can ONLY be removed at renewal Car HireIf you need to lodge a claim and you have the Keep Mobile option, weâ€™ll arrange a hire car for you while yours is off the road. If a similar make and model to your car is not available, you can choose the nearest equivalent car from our provider, but only if our provider has one available, and is within a reasonable distance of your location. You can use a hire car for as long as it takes us to settle your claim. During this time, your hire car is also covered by Copycat Cover.

Receipts will need to be retained as proof of the costs accrued. Copycat CoverIf, due to an incident covered by your policy, your car is not safe to drive, or is at our repairer, or has been stolen, you might need to borrow a friendâ€™s or relativeâ€™s wheels while yours canâ€™t be driven. The good news is that your Bingle Comprehensive Policy will cover that car while you are using it (as long as you got the ownerâ€™s permission to drive it). This also means any listed drivers are also treated as listed drivers (again, with permission). And donâ€™t forget, it also covers the hire car. However, if the other car is already insured with another insurer and suffers loss or damage, we will not cover any loss, damage or liability under your Bingle Comprehensive Car Policy. A claim should be lodged under that policy and weâ€™ll reimburse the person who paid the excess to the other insurer. You should refer to the Comprehensive Car Premiums, Excesses & Claims Guide (https://www.bingle.com.au/car-insurance/policy-documents.html) for further information on how we settle your claim. Thereâ€™s one more thing you need to know - if the borrowed car suffers loss or damage and is a total loss weâ€™ll settle for its Market Value (https://help.bingle.com.au/hc/en-us/articles/11500912076 7) if weâ€™re dealing with the claim.

To add hire car to your policy, you can add our Keep Mobile cover as an optional extra when you get a quote. You can also add this to an existing policy by logging in to manage your policy. This cover means we will arrange a hire car if you can't drive your car after an incident. You'll also have the same insurance cover (limited to the market value) which you normally hold for whatever car you're driving while your car is unavailable - whether it is a hire car, your partner's car, your friend's car, and so on. Your listed drivers will also be considered listed drivers when driving that car too. Of course, you'll need to have the Keep Mobile option on your policy before any incident takes place, you can't add it after an event and have it cover you for that same event.

Here are the reasons you can't find your car on our list when you're doing a quote. 1) Your car is imported Bingle doesn't currently offer insurance for imported vehicles, sorry! 2) Your car is a trip-tronic automatic/part time automatic (common these days) We find this affects the way the system finds your car. If yours has trip-tronic or partial auto, change the gearbox type from automatic or manual to 'other' (if shown). Your car should come up then! If it doesn't, this means we can't offer a policy for that type of car. 3) Your car is a hybrid (part petrol motor, part electric motor) This can also trip up the way the system finds your car. Try selecting the gearbox as 'other', your car should then show up! 4) Your car is 35 years or older Sorry! We canâ€™t insure cars this old.

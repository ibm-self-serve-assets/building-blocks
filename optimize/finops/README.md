# Creating a Technology Building Block for FinOps using IBM Turbonomic / IBM Apptio

## Key Aspects to Consider

### 1. **Clarity & Simplicity**
- Keep building block  **easy to understand** for FinOps and CloudOps teams.  
- Clearly highlight **cost optimization opportunities** and the purpose of the building block (e.g., rightsizing, scaling, eliminating waste).  
- Use **realistic, but safe building block workloads** that simulate cloud usage patterns.

---

### 2. **Reusability & Modularity**
- Organize the building block into **modular components**: application workloads, policies, dashboards, and reports.  
- Allow easy extension for **multi-cloud (IBM Cloud, AWS, Azure, GCP)** scenarios.  
- Provide a **baseline building block** with optional add-ons (e.g., reserved instances, spot instances).
- Highlight ***integration*** with other products such as IBM Instana, IBM Apptio as per building block.

---

### 3. **Parameterization**
- Use configuration files (`variables.tf`, `values.yaml`, or JSON configs) to set:  
  - Cloud provider  
  - Application workload size  
  - Budget thresholds  
  - Policy controls (scale up/down, suspend unused)  
- Provide **sensible defaults** so the building block runs quickly without deep customization.  

---

### 4. **Outputs & Observability**
- Show **before and after states** of optimization (cost savings, performance improvements).  
- Export **reports and dashboards**:  
  - Cost savings summary  
  - Resource utilization trends  
  - Policy compliance overview  
- To highlight Hybrid cloud cost optimization.

---

### 5. **Documentation**
Include a **README.md** that provides:  
- Overview of FinOps concepts and IBM Turbonomic capabilities.  
- **Prerequisites**: IBM Turbonomic instance, access credentials, Terraform/Helm if applicable.  
- Step-by-step instructions (deploy â†’ optimize â†’ review savings).  
- Screenshots of **dashboards, savings recommendations, policies applied**.  
- ***Architecture Diagram*** for the building block.


---

### 6. **Safety & Cost Control**
- Use **small and low-cost building block workloads**.  
- Ensure easy teardown (`terraform destroy`, `cleanup.sh`).  
- Tag building block workloads with labels like `Environment=demo` or `Owner=FinOpsDemo`.  

---

### 7. **Provider & Authentication**
- Clearly explain how to connect Turbonomic to cloud providers (e.g., IBM Cloud, AWS).  
- Document authentication via **IBM API keys, service IDs, or cloud credentials**.  

---

### 8. **Showcasing Best Practices**
- Demonstrate **continuous optimization** instead of one-time rightsizing.  
- Highlight **automation policies** that enforce scaling and cost controls.  
- Use **dashboards** to show business impact (cost per app, per team, per environment).

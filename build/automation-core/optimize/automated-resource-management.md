## **Automated Resource Management**
Automated Resource Management focuses on continuously optimizing
application performance and infrastructure efficiency by dynamically
aligning resource allocation with real-time demand. In modern hybrid and
multi-cloud environments, where workloads are highly elastic and
interdependent, this capability ensures that applications receive
precisely the resources they require --- no more, no less. It transforms
resource management from static provisioning into intelligent, automated
decision-making.

### **Why It Matters for Enterprises**

Enterprises frequently struggle with competing priorities: maintaining
application performance while controlling infrastructure and cloud
costs. Overprovisioning leads to wasted spend, while underprovisioning
risks performance degradation and SLA violations. Manual tuning cannot
keep pace with dynamic workloads. Automated resource management
eliminates this trade-off by continuously balancing performance,
utilization, and cost efficiency in real time.

### **What We Do Here**

This building block leverages platforms such as IBM Turbonomic to
analyze application demand, resource consumption patterns, and
infrastructure constraints. It enables automated actions that optimize
workload placement, scaling, and resourcing decisions. The objective is
not simply monitoring utilization metrics, but actively ensuring that
application performance objectives are met with optimal efficiency.

### **Key Features & Capabilities**

-   Real-time demand-driven resource allocation.
-   Intelligent workload placement and migration.
-   Continuous performance assurance.
-   Automated scaling and resourcing decisions.
-   Infrastructure saturation and bottleneck prevention.
-   Cost-performance optimization.

### **Core Capabilities**

Automated Resource Management delivers closed-loop automation by
continuously analyzing telemetry across applications, containers, and
infrastructure layers. It determines the most efficient resource actions
required to maintain performance objectives. By understanding
application dependencies and constraints, it avoids disruptive scaling
behaviors and instead applies precise, context-aware optimizations.

### **Use Cases**

Organizations typically adopt this capability to:

-   Prevent performance bottlenecks before user impact.
-   Eliminate overprovisioning and reduce infrastructure waste.
-   Optimize workload placement across clusters and clouds.
-   Maintain SLA compliance under fluctuating demand.
-   Improve container density and infrastructure utilization.
-   Automate scaling decisions without manual intervention.
-   Balance cost efficiency with performance requirements.

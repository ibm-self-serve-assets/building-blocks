# Data for AI Building Blocks

Data for AI focuses on enabling intelligent data management, transformation, and retrieval for AI applications. It brings together data ingestion, natural language interfaces, retrieval augmented generation, and vector search capabilities to power modern AI-driven solutions.

The Building Block of Data for AI includes:

- **RAG Building Block** – Retrieval Augmented Generation combines vector search with large language models to provide accurate, context-aware responses by retrieving relevant information from knowledge bases.
- **Natural Language to SQL** – Transform natural language questions into accurate SQL queries using AI, enabling non-technical users to access and analyze data through conversational interfaces.
- **Enterprise Intelligent Data Ingestion** – AI-powered data ingestion platform leveraging IBM Event Streams, IBM Cloud Object Storage, and IBM watsonx.data for intelligent enterprise data integration and transformation.
- **Vector Search** – Serverless vector database solutions for AI applications with enterprise-grade reliability, performance, and global distribution capabilities.

## Github Repository
Code for these accelerators can be found in the [Data for AI building blocks repo](https://github.com/ibm-self-serve-assets/building-blocks/tree/main/data-for-ai)

## Use Cases

- **RAG Building Block** → Organizations leverage RAG to build intelligent chatbots, knowledge assistants, document Q&A systems, customer support automation, and context-aware content generation that combines the power of vector search with LLMs.
- **Natural Language to SQL** → Typical scenarios include business intelligence self-service, data democratization, automated reporting, conversational analytics, and enabling non-technical users to query databases using natural language.
- **Enterprise Intelligent Data Ingestion** → Common use cases involve real-time data streaming, batch data processing, AI-powered data transformation, data quality monitoring, multi-source data integration, and preparing data for AI/ML workloads.
- **Vector Search** → Applications include semantic search, recommendation engines, fraud detection, real-time personalization, similarity matching, and powering RAG systems with efficient vector storage and retrieval.

Together, these building blocks establish a comprehensive data foundation for AI applications, enabling intelligent data access, transformation, and retrieval at enterprise scale.

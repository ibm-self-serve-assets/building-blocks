# Vector Search

**Enterprise-grade vector database solutions for AI applications with high performance, scalability, and reliability.**

## Overview

Vector search enables semantic similarity search for AI applications by storing and querying high-dimensional vector embeddings. This technology powers modern AI applications including RAG systems, recommendation engines, semantic search, and real-time personalization.

### Key Capabilities

- **Semantic Search** - Find similar items based on meaning, not just keywords
- **High Performance** - Sub-millisecond query latency at scale
- **Scalability** - Handle millions to billions of vectors
- **Enterprise Ready** - Production-grade reliability and security

### Vector Database Solutions

Our vector search building blocks include enterprise-grade database solutions that provide:

- Native vector data types and indexing
- Approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search
- Hybrid search (vector + metadata filtering)
- Global distribution and high availability
- Enterprise SLAs and support

## Use Cases

### RAG Applications
Power retrieval augmented generation systems with efficient vector storage and semantic search capabilities.

### Recommendation Engines
Build personalized recommendation systems using vector similarity to match user preferences with items.

### Semantic Search
Implement intelligent search that understands meaning and context, going beyond keyword matching.

### Fraud Detection
Identify anomalous patterns and fraudulent behavior using vector-based similarity detection.

### Real-time Personalization
Deliver personalized experiences at scale by matching user behavior vectors with content vectors.

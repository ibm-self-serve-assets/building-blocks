# Agent Builder

The IBM Agent Builder, powered by the watsonx Orchestrate Agentic Development Kit (ADK), enables developers to rapidly create autonomous task-driven AI agents that interact with enterprise apps, tools, and data.

## Why It Matters for Enterprises

- **Accelerates agent-based automation** across business functions
- **Works securely** with enterprise data, systems, and workflows
- **Enables scalable digital workforce** with observable, auditable AI
- **Reduces custom engineering effort** for AI automation

## What We Do Here

- **Design and assemble agents** using Agent Builder + ADK
- **Configure agent behavior** including instructions, rules, boundaries, and escalation paths
- **Connect to enterprise capabilities** such as tools, apps, data/knowledge sources, and channels
- **Generate deployable assets** as versionable artifacts that teams can review, test, and operationalize

## Key Features & Capabilities

### Agent Development Kit (ADK)
- Packaged as a **Python library** and **CLI tool**
- Enables configuration of agents that run on the **watsonx Orchestrate platform**
- Supports integrating agents and tools built on **other frameworks**

### Development & Deployment
- **Developer Edition** for local builds and rapid iteration, allowing you to test and refine agents in isolation
- Once validated, agents can be seamlessly shared and deployed into a **production instance of watsonx Orchestrate** for team-wide use

### Core Capabilities
- **Prompt configuration** - Define agent instructions and behavior
- **Tool integration** - Connect agents to enterprise systems and APIs
- **Evaluate agents** - Test and validate agent performance, accuracy, and behavior
- **Lifecycle management** - Version, test, and deploy agents with confidence

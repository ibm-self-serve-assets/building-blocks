# Agents – AI Building Blocks

This framework provides ready-to-use accelerators that make it easier to operationalize AI and GenAI use cases.  Each accelerator addresses a critical capability required to build, integrate, and scale AI-driven applications. These accelerators are designed to integrate seamlessly with enterprise systems, reducing time-to-value for AI projects. By standardizing agent creation, orchestration, and governance, the framework ensures scalability, trust, and efficiency across diverse workloads.

The Building Block of Agents includes:

- **Agent Builder** – Create and deploy agents  
- **AI Gateway** – Connect third-party and IBM models  
- **Multi-Agent Orchestration** – Coordinate agents, tools, and humans  

## Github Repository
Code for these accelerators can be found in the [Agents building blocks repo](https://github.com/ibm-self-serve-assets/building-blocks/tree/main/agents)

## Use Cases

- **Agent Builder** → Build an HR assistant that automates leave approvals using Workday APIs.  
- **AI Gateway** → Register both **watsonx.ai Granite models** and **OpenAI GPT** in one place, letting agents dynamically select the best LLM.  
- **Multi-Agent Orchestration** → Automate a **sales pipeline workflow** where Salesforce data, Outlook meetings, and Slack updates are coordinated across teams.

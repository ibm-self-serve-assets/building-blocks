# AI Core Capabilities

The AI Core Capabilities consist of three foundational building blocks that accelerate enterprise AI adoption. AI Core Capabilities enable enterprises to design, deploy, and govern AI solutions in a secure, scalable, and reusable manner.


1. **Agents** – Pre-built components for designing, orchestrating, and deploying intelligent agents across business workflows, enabling rapid agent adoption at enterprise scale.

2. **Trust** – Tools for evaluating, tuning, and comparing prompts and models to ensure optimal performance, transparency, compliance, and responsible AI practices across use cases.

3. **Data** – Capabilities that provide intelligent access to enterprise data, enabling faster decision-making, improved productivity, and more efficient interactions with complex systems.

These building blocks are part of IBM's broader Building Blocks framework—embeddable, production-ready components that reduce engineering effort, minimize risk, and accelerate time-to-value while maintaining enterprise-grade security, scalability, and governance.

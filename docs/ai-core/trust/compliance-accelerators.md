# Compliance Accelerators

## Why This Matters

Building a high-quality, safe AI system is only half the challenge. Enterprises must also **prove** that their systems meet regulatory and industry standards — and they must do so continuously, not just at launch. The compliance accelerator bridges the gap between the technical work of AI engineering and the documentation demands of risk, legal, and compliance teams.

For enterprise teams, this is critical because:

- **Regulatory pressure is growing.** The EU AI Act, NIST AI RMF, ISO 42001, and other frameworks impose concrete requirements on AI transparency, risk assessment, and human oversight. Non-compliance carries financial penalties and market access restrictions.
- **Manual compliance is unsustainable.** Assembling evaluation results, monitoring logs, and risk documentation by hand for every model — and keeping it current as models evolve — is slow, error-prone, and doesn't scale.
- **Evidence already exists but isn't connected.** Design-time evaluations produce quality metrics and factsheets. Runtime monitoring generates safety logs and drift records. The problem isn't a lack of evidence — it's that the evidence is scattered across tools and teams, and isn't mapped to the specific requirements that auditors need.
- **Compliance is continuous, not one-time.** Models change, data drifts, and regulations evolve. Organizations need a governance posture that stays current automatically rather than requiring periodic manual reassembly.


## IBM watsonx.governance Compliance Accelerator Overview

IBM watsonx.governance Compliance Accelerator is a Data-as-a-Service solution designed to support an organization’s AI compliance efforts. It provides curated AI and model risk regulatory content through predefined Compliance Plans and associated Obligations. These plans group relevant requirements to address specific risks and clarify compliance expectations for model-based systems, including generative AI. The content is regularly updated to reflect changes in regulatory and industry frameworks.

Key features include:

- Clear guidance for model use case owners and compliance teams, including defined evidence requirements

- Regularly updated regulatory and framework content

- Coverage of major global frameworks, including the EU AI Act and the NIST AI RMF

- A preformatted data feed that can be directly imported into IBM watsonx.governance

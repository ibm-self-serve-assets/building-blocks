# **Build and Deploy**

Build and Deploy focuses on accelerating application delivery while
ensuring consistency, security, and automation across environments. This
building block enables organizations to standardize integration,
identity, provisioning, and development workflows, reducing friction
between development and operations. By combining platform services,
automation frameworks, and AI-assisted tooling, enterprises can move
from manual processes to repeatable, scalable delivery pipelines.

- **Platform as a Service (iPaaS)** Capabilities, delivered through IBM
webMethods, simplify application and data integration across distributed
systems.
- **Authentication Management** Enabled by IBM Verify, centralizes identity,
access control, and security enforcement.
- **Infrastructure as Code** Powered by tools such as Terraform and Ansible,
ensures consistent, automated environment provisioning.
- **Code Assistant** Supported by IBM Bob enhances developer productivity through AI-assisted code generation and
modernization.

## Github Repository
Code for these accelerators can be found in the [Build - Automation Building Blocks repo.](https://github.com/ibm-self-serve-assets/building-blocks/tree/main/build)

### **Key Use Cases**

**Platform as a Service (IBM webMethods)**
Organizations leverage this capability to integrate cloud and on-prem
applications, orchestrate business workflows, enable API management,
connect legacy systems, synchronize data across platforms, and
streamline hybrid integration architectures.

**Authentication Management (IBM Verify)**
Typical scenarios include centralized identity and access management,
single sign-on (SSO), multi-factor authentication (MFA), adaptive access
policies, privileged access control, and securing application workloads
across hybrid environments.

**Infrastructure as Code (Terraform, Ansible)**
Common use cases involve automated infrastructure provisioning,
environment standardization, configuration management, deployment
automation, drift prevention, multi-cloud orchestration, and repeatable
DevOps pipelines.

**Code Assistant (IBM Bob)**
Organizations adopt this capability to accelerate code development,
modernize legacy applications, generate automation scripts, assist with
refactoring, improve developer efficiency, reduce manual coding effort,
and support consistent implementation patterns.

Together, these capabilities create a cohesive Build and Deploy model
that enhances delivery speed, improves operational consistency, and
embeds automation and security into the software lifecycle.

# **Observe Building Blocks**

Observe focuses on delivering deep, real-time visibility into
application behavior, infrastructure performance, and network health
across hybrid and multi-cloud environments. It enables enterprises to
detect anomalies early, accelerate troubleshooting, and maintain service
reliability by transforming telemetry into actionable operational
intelligence.

The Building Block of Observe includes:

-   **Application Observability** -- enabled by Instana, provides
    automated, full-stack observability with granular visibility into
    applications, microservices, containers, and underlying
    infrastructure. It continuously analyzes performance metrics,
    traces, and dependencies to detect issues before they impact users.

-   **Network Performance** -- powered by IBM SevOne, delivers
    comprehensive monitoring and analytics across complex network
    environments. It enables enterprises to understand traffic behavior,
    identify performance degradation, and ensure network reliability at
    scale.

## **Github Repository**

Code for these accelerators can be found in the [Observe -- Automation
Building Blocks
repo](https://github.com/ibm-self-serve-assets/building-blocks/tree/main/observe)

## **Use Cases**

-   **Application Observability (Instana)** → Organizations leverage
    this capability to gain real-time visibility into application
    performance, automatically detect anomalies, trace transactions
    across microservices, accelerate root cause analysis, monitor
    Kubernetes / OpenShift workloads, and reduce mean time to resolution
    (MTTR).

-   **Network Performance (IBM SevOne)** → Typical use cases include
    end-to-end network visibility, proactive detection of network
    bottlenecks, traffic flow analysis, capacity planning, performance
    trend analysis, SLA monitoring, and ensuring reliability across
    distributed enterprise networks.

Together, these building blocks establish a continuous observability
model where application intelligence and network analytics work in
tandem to improve operational stability, performance assurance, and
incident response efficiency.

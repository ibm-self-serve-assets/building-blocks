# **Automation Core Capabilities**
Automation capabilities empower organizations to design, operate, and
continuously improve hybrid cloud environments with greater speed,
consistency, and reliability. By integrating intelligent tooling,
platform services, and operational workflows, enterprises can reduce
manual intervention, minimize risk, and scale efficiently across dynamic
infrastructures.

Automation is no longer limited to deployment tasks --- it becomes a
strategic enabler that drives operational stability, cost efficiency,
performance assurance, and development agility. Through a structured
automation approach, organizations can effectively build, observe, and
optimize modern application ecosystems.

## **Automation Building Blocks**

To simplify adoption and ensure architectural alignment, automation is
organized into three complementary building blocks:

### **Build and Deploy**

Build and Deploy focuses on accelerating application delivery while
maintaining consistency, security, and repeatability. This building
block standardizes how infrastructure is provisioned, how applications
are integrated, and how deployment workflows are executed.

It enables organizations to:

-   Automate infrastructure provisioning.
-   Standardize application deployment.
-   Simplify system integration.
-   Strengthen identity and access controls.
-   Improve developer productivity.

Build and Deploy establishes the foundation for scalable DevOps and
CI/CD practices.

### **Observe**

Observe centers on delivering deep operational visibility across
applications, infrastructure, and networks. It transforms telemetry into
actionable intelligence, enabling teams to detect anomalies early,
accelerate troubleshooting, and maintain service reliability.

It enables organizations to:

-   Monitor application performance in real time.
-   Analyze distributed system behavior.
-   Identify performance bottlenecks.
-   Detect anomalies proactively.
-   Improve incident response efficiency.

Observe ensures that dynamic environments remain transparent and
manageable.

### **Optimize**

Optimize emphasizes continuous improvement of efficiency, resilience,
and resource utilization. It aligns financial intelligence, operational
stability, and automated decision-making to ensure sustainable cloud
operations.

It enables organizations to:

-   Improve cost efficiency.
-   Strengthen resilience and compliance posture.
-   Automate resource management.
-   Prevent performance degradation.
-   Balance cost-performance trade-offs.

Optimize transforms operations into a closed-loop improvement model.

## **Unified Automation Strategy**

Together, Build and Deploy, Observe, and Optimize create a cohesive
automation framework. Each building block reinforces the others:

-   Build establishes repeatability.
-   Observe provides operational intelligence.
-   Optimize drives continuous improvement

This integrated model enables enterprises to scale hybrid cloud
environments with greater predictability, stability, and efficiency.

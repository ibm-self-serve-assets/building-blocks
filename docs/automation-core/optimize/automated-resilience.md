## **Automated Resilience & Compliance**
Automated Resilience & Compliance focuses on continuously safeguarding
application stability, security posture, and regulatory alignment across
complex hybrid cloud environments. It provides enterprises with unified
visibility into operational risks, vulnerabilities, and compliance
deviations, enabling proactive rather than reactive management. This
building block transforms resilience and governance from periodic audits
into continuous, automated practices.

### **Why It Matters for Enterprises**

Modern enterprises operate highly distributed, containerized workloads
where risks emerge dynamically --- from newly disclosed vulnerabilities
to configuration drift and certificate expirations. Manual monitoring
and fragmented tooling create blind spots, slow response times, and
increased exposure. Continuous resilience and compliance automation
reduces operational risk, strengthens governance, minimizes downtime,
and supports regulatory obligations without introducing friction into
delivery pipelines.

### **What We Do Here**

This building block centralizes resilience and compliance intelligence
using platforms such as IBM Concert, correlating security, runtime, and
configuration insights. It enables organizations to detect
vulnerabilities, identify systemic weaknesses, evaluate compliance
posture, and prioritize remediation actions based on risk impact. The
emphasis is on creating actionable intelligence rather than simply
generating alerts.

### **Key Features & Capabilities**

-   Unified visibility across applications, clusters, and environments.
-   Continuous vulnerability and CVE exposure monitoring.
-   Compliance posture tracking and drift detection.
-   Certificate lifecycle and expiration management.
-   Dependency and risk correlation across services.
-   Risk-based prioritization and remediation guidance.

### **Core Capabilities**

Automated Resilience & Compliance delivers continuous risk intelligence
by combining operational telemetry, vulnerability data, and governance
signals. It helps enterprises understand not only *what is wrong*, but
also *why it matters* and *where to act first*. By correlating
application dependencies, infrastructure conditions, and security
findings, it enables more accurate impact analysis and faster
decision-making.

### **Use Cases**

Organizations typically adopt this capability to:

-   Continuously detect and assess CVE exposure across workloads.
-   Identify compliance drift across Kubernetes / OpenShift
    environments.
-   Prevent outages caused by expired or mismanaged certificates.
-   Map vulnerabilities to affected applications and business services.
-   Prioritize remediation based on risk severity and blast radius.
-   Improve audit readiness through continuous compliance tracking.

# IBM Building Block Assets – Embeddable AI & Automation

## Introduction  
The **Building Block** is a collection of **minimum viable use cases (MVPs)** designed to showcase the strength of the IBM offerings stack, with a particular emphasis on **Embeddable AI**.  
These use cases demonstrate seamless integration across the **Data & AI** and **Automation** stack.  

The assets serve a dual purpose:  
- Empowering engineers and architects with **reusable code, deployment scripts, and integration patterns**.  
- Delivering **client-ready MVPs** that highlight IBM’s value to partners and customers.  

Standardized MVPs ensure consistent, high-quality demonstrations of business outcomes such as **scalability, governance, observability, and cost optimization** — accelerating innovation, enhancing client impact, and streamlining technical enablement.

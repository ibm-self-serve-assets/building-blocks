      **Core Principles for All Data Work:**
      
      1. **Data Quality First**: Always validate data formats, handle edge cases, implement proper error handling, and monitor data quality metrics
      2. **Security & Compliance**: Never expose sensitive data, implement proper authentication/authorization, handle PII appropriately, and follow GDPR/CCPA requirements
      3. **Performance & Scalability**: Consider indexing strategies, partitioning, batch processing, caching, and design for horizontal scaling
      4. **Documentation**: Create comprehensive technical docs, data dictionaries, schema diagrams, and pipeline documentation
      5. **Monitoring & Observability**: Implement logging, metrics, alerting, and data quality dashboards
      6. **Cost Optimization**: Consider storage costs, compute efficiency, and data transfer optimization
      
      **For Data Engineering Tasks:**
      - Design idempotent pipelines that can safely retry
      - Implement proper error handling and dead letter queues
      - Use incremental loading strategies for large datasets
      - Add data validation at ingestion and transformation stages
      - Create unit tests for transformation logic
      - Use appropriate data formats (Parquet, Avro) for efficiency
      - Implement proper logging and monitoring
      
      **For Data Architecture Tasks:**
      - Start with understanding business requirements and data access patterns
      - Choose appropriate normalization levels based on use case
      - Design for both OLTP and OLAP workloads appropriately
      - Consider data retention policies and archival strategies
      - Plan for data versioning and schema evolution
      - Document data lineage and dependencies
      - Create clear naming conventions and standards
      
      **For AI/ML Data Operations:**
      - When implementing RAG: Choose chunking strategies based on document type, optimize embedding models for domain, implement hybrid search when appropriate
      - When implementing NL2SQL: Always validate SQL for safety (no DROP, DELETE without WHERE), understand schema before generating queries, handle ambiguous queries gracefully
      - For vector databases: Optimize index parameters, implement proper similarity metrics, monitor query performance
      - For embeddings: Batch processing for efficiency, cache embeddings when possible, version embedding models

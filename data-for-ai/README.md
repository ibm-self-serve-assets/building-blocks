# Building Block of Data for AI

Welcome to the **Building Block of Data for AI**. 

This framework provides ready-to-use accelerators that make it easier to operationalize data for AI/GenAI use cases. Each accelerator addresses a critical capability required to manage, process, and secure data for AI-driven applications. These accelerators are designed to integrate seamlessly with existing enterprise systems, reducing time-to-value for AI projects. By standardizing data access, governance, and enrichment, the framework ensures scalability, trust, and efficiency across diverse AI workloads.

## Zero-Copy Lakehouse
- Enables seamless querying across databases, warehouses, and cloud object stores without data duplication.  
- Reduces **costs and latency** by eliminating data movement.  

---

## Vector Search
- Provides a **vector-based retrieval service** for GenAI pipelines.   
- Powers **semantic similarity search** for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).  
- Optimized for **scalable AI workloads**.  

---

## Question & Answer
- Delivers **natural language interfaces** to interact with data.  
- **watsonx.data intelligence Text2SQL** converts natural language questions into executable SQL.    

---

## Data Security & Encryption 
- Protects sensitive data through **masking, encryption, and access controls**.  
- Enhances **data governance** and regulatory compliance.  

---

## Getting Started

Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/building-block-agents.git
cd data-for-ai
```

Review the accelerators inside the repo:

- `zero-copy-lakehouse/`  
- `vector-search/`  
- `q-and-a/`  
- `data-security-and-encryption/` 

Follow the documentation in each folder to integrate the accelerator into your application.

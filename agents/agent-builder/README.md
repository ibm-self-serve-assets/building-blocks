# Agent Builder

## Overview

The **Agent Builder** building block enables developers to rapidly create autonomous, task-driven AI agents using the IBM watsonx Orchestrate Agentic Development Kit (ADK). These agents interact seamlessly with enterprise applications, tools, and data to automate business functions at scale.

## What It Does

- **Design & Assemble Agents**: Build agents using Agent Builder + ADK with configurable behaviors, instructions, rules, and boundaries
- **Enterprise Integration**: Connect agents to enterprise tools, apps, data sources, and communication channels
- **Deployable Artifacts**: Generate versionable, reviewable assets ready for testing and production deployment
- **Secure & Observable**: Work with enterprise data securely while maintaining full auditability and observability

## Why Use It?

- ✅ Accelerate agent-based automation across business functions
- ✅ Reduce custom engineering effort for AI automation
- ✅ Scale your digital workforce with enterprise-grade security
- ✅ Maintain control with configurable escalation paths and boundaries

## How to Use

### 1. Explore Pre-existing Assets
Browse the sample projects and demos to understand agent capabilities and implementation patterns:
- Review the [Contextual Knowledge Hub](./contextual-knowledge-hub/) for working examples
- Study existing agent configurations and integrations

### 2. Build Your Own Agent
Use Bob modes to start building custom agents:
- Explore the **Agent Builder Bob Mode** for guided agent development
- Configure agent behaviors, rules, and enterprise integrations
- Generate deployable artifacts for your use case
